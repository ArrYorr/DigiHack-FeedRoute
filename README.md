# FeedRoute ðŸŒ¾

*Sell your crops directly, earn more.*

FeedRoute is a modern, mobile-first web application designed to bridge the gap between farmers and customers. It serves as a two-sided marketplace where farmers can upload their produce for sale, and customers can browse, purchase, and order fresh goods directly from the source.
